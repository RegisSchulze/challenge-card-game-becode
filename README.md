# challenge-card-game-becode Regis Schulze

In this project the goal is to create a card game for at least 2 players

I first created the must have features but was also able to add some nice to have features
-the cards are still randomly selected from the players hand
-however the player with a higher value from following list  ['A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K'] will win over the other players ex. Q wins from 6
-if the players have the same value than we compare the one which have a higher icon from list ['♥', '♦', '♣', '♠'] will win ex. ♠  wins from ♦

I learned a from this project!!!
