In this project the goal is to create a card game for at least 2 players

I created the must have features


We want you to build a basis for a card game. There is not actual game being played in the must-have version. There are no points that get counted.
What we want is just that a deck of cards gets created, and split between the different players and each player plays a card at every turn, until there are no cards left.

- The game is working until each player doesn't have any cards left.
- The game generates all the cards.
- The game distributes all the cards.
